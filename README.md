# AI_Powered_Calci_project

## Overview

The AI-Powered Virtual Calculator is an innovative application that allows users to perform mathematical operations using hand gestures. It leverages OpenCV for real-time hand gesture recognition and utilizes Gemini's API to process mathematical expressions and provide detailed outputs. The interface is built using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses OpenCV to detect and interpret hand gestures for mathematical input.
- **AI-Powered Computation**: Integrates Gemini's API for solving mathematical expressions with detailed explanations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Performs real-time recognition and computation for fast results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for hand gesture detection)
- **Streamlit** (for UI development)
- **Gemini API** (for processing and solving math expressions)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for numerical computations, if needed)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-virtual-calculator.git
   cd ai-virtual-calculator
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 
3. Run the application:

   streamlit run main.py

## Working

1. The system captures real-time hand gestures using OpenCV and processes them into recognizable mathematical symbols.

2. The detected gestures are converted into mathematical expressions.

3. These expressions are sent to the Gemini API for computation and detailed explanation.

4. The results are displayed on the Streamlit interface in real time.
