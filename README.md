# AI_Powered_Calci_project

## Overview

The AI-Powered Virtual Calculator is an innovative application that allows users to perform mathematical operations using hand gestures. It leverages OpenCV for real-time hand gesture recognition and utilizes Gemini's API to process mathematical expressions and provide detailed outputs. The interface is built using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses OpenCV to detect and interpret hand gestures for mathematical input.
- **AI-Powered Computation**: Integrates Gemini's API for solving mathematical expressions with detailed explanations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Performs real-time recognition and computation for fast results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for hand gesture detection)
- **Streamlit** (for UI development)
- **Gemini API** (for processing and solving math expressions)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for numerical computations, if needed)
